## 👀 Introduction

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/model.png" width="100%" alt="Hepato-LLaVA Framework"/>
</p>

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) relies on histopathological **Whole Slide Images (WSIs)** examination as the gold standard. However, manual analysis of these gigapixel, highly heterogeneous WSIs is labor-intensive and prone to inter-observer variability. This has catalyzed WSI-based **Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs)** to enable VQA.

A key challenge in pathology MLLMs is gigapixel WSI representation. Existing methods either use **thumbnail-based approaches** that lose critical high-resolution diagnostic details, or employ **slide-encoder approaches** that generate excessively redundant tokens.

We propose **Hepato-LLaVA**, a specialized MLLM for fine-grained hepatocellular pathology analysis. It features a novel **Hierarchical Sparse Visual Attention (HSVA)** mechanism that models 2D tissue topology to aggregate diagnostic evidence while preserving context. To address multiscale data scarcity, we also present **HepatoPathoVQA**, comprising **33K hierarchically structured QA pairs** validated by pathologists. **Hepato-LLaVA** achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy, outperforming existing pathology MLLMs by an absolute **20%**.

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wssf3092/Hepato-LLaVA.git
cd Hepato-LLaVA

conda create -n hepato_llava python=3.10 -y
conda activate hepato_llava

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the patch encoder, please follow the official installation instructions of [CONCH](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CONCH) to set up the model and obtain the pretrained weights.

---

## 📦 Data Preparation

### Feature Extraction

Use the CONCH encoder to extract patch-level features from WSIs:

```bash
bash data/feature/1_run.sh
```

For data augmentation (generating 9 variants per WSI):

```bash
bash data/feature/1_run_augment.sh
```

### Data Format Conversion

Convert VQA data to LLaVA fine-tuning format:

- `data/conversation/qa.py` — convert QA JSONL to LLaVA fine-tuning format
- `data/conversation/caption.py` — convert captioning data to fine-tuning format

---

## 🚀 Training

Hepato-LLaVA follows a three-stage training pipeline:

**Stage 1: MAE Pre-training** — Self-supervised pre-training of the HSAN slide encoder with curriculum masking (patch-level → pack-level):

```bash
bash scripts/run_mae.sh
```

**Stage 2: MoCo Pre-training** — Contrastive learning for summary token representations:

```bash
bash scripts/run_moco_summary.sh
```

**Stage 3: LLaVA Fine-tuning** — End-to-end fine-tuning with DeepSpeed and LoRA:

```bash
bash scripts/run_llava_finetune.sh
```

---

## 🔍 Inference & Evaluation

Run VQA evaluation:

```bash
bash scripts/run_eval_vqa.sh
```

For GPT-4 based open-ended evaluation:

```bash
python scripts/eval_open.py
```

For choice question statistics:

```bash
python scripts/stat_choice.py
```
